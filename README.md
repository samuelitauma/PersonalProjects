Git Repository containing some of my Coding pieces. 
Currently they include:

      1)API Pagination – Python Code which searches through all the pages of a football API and extracts the wanted information. It then saves this information as a CSV file. 

      2)Ai Querying SQL Database – Python Code which connects to a Ai source, configures its settings and trains to query a SQL database containing football data. 

      3)LYST Function – Python Code which searches, extracts and sends Male Bags which are discounted to a specified email.
